                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Shahada (Faith):</strong> Declaring there is no god except Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Salah (Prayer):</strong> Performing the five daily prayers.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Zakat (Charity):</strong> Giving a portion of one's wealth to those in need.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Sawm (Fasting):</strong> Fasting during the month of Ramadan.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Hajj (Pilgrimage):</strong> Making the pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime if able.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="basic-content" style="display: none;">
                                        <p>The Five Pillars of Islam form the foundation of Muslim life. Each pillar carries deep spiritual significance:</p>

                                        <h4>1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith)</h4>
                                        <p>The declaration, "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" (Lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh, Muḥammadun rasūlu llāh), represents the absolute monotheism of Islam and acceptance of Muhammad's prophethood. It's the gateway to becoming a Muslim.</p>

                                        <h4>2. Salah (Prayer)</h4>
                                        <p>Muslims pray five times daily: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha (night). Prayer involves physical movements that symbolize submission to Allah and recitation of Quranic verses. It serves as a regular reminder of one's relationship with Allah and provides spiritual rejuvenation.</p>

                                        <h4>3. Zakat (Charitable Giving)</h4>
                                        <p>Zakat is an annual 2.5% payment from one's wealth to those in need. It purifies wealth, prevents hoarding, and establishes economic justice. Recipients include the poor, debtors, travelers in need, and those dedicated to religious service.</p>

                                        <h4>4. Sawm (Fasting)</h4>
                                        <p>During Ramadan (the ninth month of the Islamic calendar), Muslims abstain from food, drink, and marital relations from dawn until sunset. Fasting teaches self-discipline, empathy for the hungry, and heightens spiritual awareness. It's a time for increased prayer, charity, and Quran recitation.</p>

                                        <h4>5. Hajj (Pilgrimage)</h4>
                                        <p>The annual pilgrimage to Mecca must be performed once in a lifetime if physically and financially able. Hajj symbolizes unity of believers, as millions gather in identical white garments, removing distinctions of class, wealth, and status. It commemorates the actions of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his family.</p>

                                            <li><strong>Belief in Allah:</strong> The One and Only God.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Belief in Angels:</strong> Created by Allah to serve Him.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Belief in Divine Books:</strong> Including the Quran, Torah, Gospel, and Psalms.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Belief in Prophets:</strong> Including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Belief in the Day of Judgment:</strong> When all souls will be judged.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Belief in Divine Decree:</strong> That Allah has knowledge and control over all things.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="basic-content" style="display: none;">
                                        <p>The Six Articles of Faith form the theological foundation of a Muslim's belief system:</p>

                                        <h4>1. Belief in Allah (Tawhid)</h4>
                                        <p>Muslims believe in one, unique, incomparable God who has no son nor partner. Allah is the Creator, Sustainer, and Provider of the universe. He is described through 99 beautiful names (Asma ul-Husna) that reflect His attributes like the Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman), the Most Wise (Al-Hakeem), and the Most Just (Al-Adl).</p>

                                        <h4>2. Belief in Angels (Mala'ika)</h4>
                                        <p>Angels are created from light (nur) and serve Allah without disobedience. Major angels include Jibreel (Gabriel) who delivered revelation, Mikael (Michael) who controls provision, Israfil who will blow the trumpet on Judgment Day, and Izrael, the angel of death. Others include Munkar and Nakir who question souls in graves, and Raqib and Atid who record deeds.</p>

                                        <h4>3. Belief in Divine Books (Kutub)</h4>
                                        <p>Muslims believe Allah revealed books to His messengers as guidance. These include the Scrolls of Abraham (Suhuf), the Torah given to Moses (Tawrat), the Psalms given to David (Zabur), the Gospel given to Jesus (Injil), and the Quran revealed to Muhammad. Muslims believe only the Quran remains in its original, unaltered form.</p>

                                        <h4>4. Belief in Prophets (Rusul)</h4>
                                        <p>Allah sent prophets to every nation to guide humanity. Twenty-five are mentioned by name in the Quran, including Adam, Noah (Nuh), Abraham (Ibrahim), Moses (Musa), Jesus (Isa), and Muhammad. Muslims believe Muhammad is the final prophet, the "Seal of the Prophets," whose message is universal for all humanity until the Day of Judgment.</p>

                                        <h4>5. Belief in the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah)</h4>
                                        <p>Life on earth is a test, and after death comes resurrection and judgment. Each person's deeds will be weighed, determining eternal destination in Paradise (Jannah) or Hell (Jahannam). The Quran describes signs preceding the Day of Judgment and its terrifying events in detail.</p>

                                        <h4>6. Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar)</h4>
                                        <p>Allah has full knowledge and power over all things. While Allah knows what choices humans will make, humans have free will and are responsible for their actions. This concept balances divine sovereignty with human accountability, teaching that while circumstances may be predestined, how one responds to them is a matter of choice.</p>

                                        <p>Tawheed is the central concept in Islam that refers to the absolute oneness of Allah. It means believing in:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>One God who has no partners or equals</li>
                                            <li>God alone deserves worship</li>
                                            <li>God is unique in His names and attributes</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Maintaining pure Tawheed means rejecting all forms of idolatry and polytheism.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="basic-content" style="display: none;">
                                        <p>Tawheed (monotheism) is the foundational principle of Islam and is divided into three categories:</p>

                                        <h4>1. Tawheed ar-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Lordship)</h4>
                                        <p>This affirms that Allah alone is the Creator, Sustainer, and Controller of the universe. He causes life and death, provides sustenance, controls weather patterns, and manages all affairs. The Quran states: "Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian over all things" (39:62).</p>

                                        <h4>2. Tawheed al-Uluhiyyah (Oneness of Worship)</h4>
                                        <p>This mandates that all acts of worship must be directed solely to Allah. Prayers, supplications, sacrifices, vows, seeking help in distress, and all religious rituals must be performed for Allah alone. Directing any form of worship to other than Allah constitutes shirk (polytheism), which is the gravest sin in Islam. The Quran emphasizes: "And worship Allah and associate nothing with Him" (4:36).</p>

                                        <h4>3. Tawheed al-Asma wa-Sifat (Oneness of Names and Attributes)</h4>
                                        <p>This involves affirming the names and attributes that Allah has affirmed for Himself in the Quran or through His Prophet, without distortion, denial, questioning their nature, or anthropomorphism. Allah describes Himself: "There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer" (42:11).</p>

                                        <p>The opposite of Tawheed is Shirk (associating partners with Allah), which has various forms:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Major Shirk:</strong> Worshipping others alongside Allah, which nullifies one's faith if not repented from</li>
                                            <li><strong>Minor Shirk:</strong> Actions that may lead to major shirk, such as swearing by other than Allah or showing off in worship</li>
                                            <li><strong>Hidden Shirk:</strong> Subtle forms of showing off or having intentions other than pleasing Allah in acts of worship</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                        <p>The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ over 23 years (610-632 CE) through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). The first revelation came in the Cave of Hira with the words "Read! In the name of your Lord who created" (96:1).</p>

                                        <p>During the Prophet's lifetime, the Quran was preserved through:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Memorization:</strong> The Prophet and his Companions memorized the Quran as it was revealed</li>
                                            <li><strong>Written records:</strong> Scribes wrote down revelations on various materials like parchment and bone</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>After the Prophet's death, the first Caliph Abu Bakr ordered the compilation of the Quran into one manuscript. Later, during Uthman's caliphate, standardized copies were made and distributed to major Muslim centers, establishing a uniform text that has remained unchanged.</p>

                                        <h4>Structure and Content</h4>
                                        <p>The Quran contains 114 surahs arranged roughly by length (except for Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter). It is also divided into 30 equal parts (juz') to facilitate reading during Ramadan.</p>

                                        <p>Major themes include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Theology:</strong> Oneness of God, His attributes, creation, angels</li>
                                            <li><strong>Prophets and their stories:</strong> Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others</li>
                                            <li><strong>Ethical and moral teachings:</strong> Justice, kindness, honesty, family relations</li>
                                            <li><strong>Legal rulings:</strong> Inheritance, marriage, business transactions</li>
                                            <li><strong>Eschatology:</strong> Death, resurrection, judgment, paradise, hellfire</li>
                                            <li><strong>Scientific signs:</strong> References to natural phenomena consistent with modern scientific discoveries</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h4>Miracle of the Quran</h4>
                                        <p>Muslims believe the Quran is miraculous in several ways:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Linguistic excellence:</strong> Unmatched literary style and eloquence</li>
                                            <li><strong>Scientific accuracy:</strong> Descriptions of natural phenomena unknown at the time of revelation</li>
                                            <li><strong>Historical accuracy:</strong> Correct accounts of past events</li>
                                            <li><strong>Prophecies:</strong> Future events that later occurred</li>
                                            <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Unchanged text for over 1400 years</li>
                                            <li><strong>Comprehensive guidance:</strong> Complete system covering spiritual, moral, social, and legal dimensions</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>The Quran challenges humanity: "And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant, then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful" (2:23)—a challenge that remains unmet.</p>

                                        <h5>Acts Permitted with Tayammum</h5>
                                        <p>With tayammum, one may perform all acts of worship that require wudu or ghusl, including:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Obligatory and voluntary prayers</li>
                                            <li>Touching and reciting the Quran</li>

                                        <h5>Limitations</h5>
                                        <p>Unlike wudu, which remains valid until broken, tayammum becomes invalid when:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Water becomes available and accessible</li>
                                            <li>The reason permitting tayammum no longer exists</li>
                                            <li>Any of the normal nullifiers of wudu occur</li>

                                        <p>Tajweed refers to the rules governing pronunciation during Quran recitation. Here are some essential rules to start with:</p>

                                            <li><strong>Ghunnah (Nasalization):</strong> When you see noon (ن) or meem (م) with a shadda (ّ), hold the sound for 2 counts with a nasal tone</li>
                                            <li><strong>Madd (Elongation):</strong> Certain letter combinations require extending the sound for 2, 4, or 6 counts</li>
                                            <li><strong>Qalqalah (Echo/Bounce):</strong> Five letters (ق ط ب ج د) produce a slight bounce sound when they have sukun (ْ)</li>
                                            <li><strong>Stopping (Waqf):</strong> When stopping at the end of a verse, the last letter usually becomes unvoweled (with sukun)</li>
                                            <li><strong>Starting (Ibtida'):</strong> Start with a connected sound if the first letter has a vowel</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <p>The best way to learn tajweed is to listen to qualified reciters and practice with a teacher who can correct your pronunciation.</p>
